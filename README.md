# Solutions to Exercises in dDist 2014

[dDist 2014](https://services.brics.dk/java/courseadmin/dDist) is the
2014 version of the course on distributed systems at Aarhus University.
Part of the course are a number of
[exercises](https://services.brics.dk/java/courseadmin/dDist/pages/Exercises+%282014%29)
and this repository contains our solutions to most of them.

The biggest exercise was creating a distributed, collaborative text
editor, i. e. an editor where multiple users on different machines can
edit the same text at the same time. The source code to this can be
found in ex09. We also had to write handins describing our system. They
can be found in ex09-handin, ex11-handin and ex14-handin.

Jesper Buus Nielsen, the instructor of the course, provided the sources
for the basic text editor. They were added in
[2194cca](https://github.com/neic/dDist/commit/2194cca708b0b334aff5b548f4bf322d20cac0ea).

## Bugs

The editor words quite well generally. However, we didn't have time to
fix some more serious issues, most of which are written down in
ex09-handin/known-bugs.txt.
